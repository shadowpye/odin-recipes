            <li>Thinly slice the remaining 5 garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>If you are using chicken drumsticks, make sure to score the meat portion a couple of times.</li>

            <li>Give it a mix nicely to coat all the chicken pieces. Keep it aside for minimum 4 hrs or overnight for maximum flavor blend.</li>
            <li>When ready, place a heavy bottom nonstick pan on the stove at medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the oil along with the sliced garlic, chopped green chili and chopped ginger.</li>
            <li>As the oil heats up, the garlic will start to sizzle and slowly turn golden brown.</li>

            <li>Then add the marinated chicken and stir it to incorporate everything.</li>
            <li>you are using boneless chicken cubes, it will take 15minutes to cook the chicken. If you use chicken with bones in, then it will take about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of cooking the chicken, it will start to release water. Now depending on how much gravy you want, add water and let it continue cooking.</li>

            <li>Finally sprinkle finely chopped cilantro leaves, garam masala powder and give it a mix.</li>
